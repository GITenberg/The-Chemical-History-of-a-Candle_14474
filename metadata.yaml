description: '"Michael Faraday''s celebrated series of lectures, The Chemical History
  of a Candle, turned into one of the most successful science books ever published
  and was a classic work of Victorian popular science. They also reflect how Faraday,
  the bookbinder''s apprentice turned scientist, was a remarkable communicator of
  science.'
